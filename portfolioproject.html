                    <h3>Description</h3>
                    <p class="project-description">
                        This portfolio website is a personal showcase of my skills, certifications, and projects as a final-year Computer Science Engineering student specializing in Artificial Intelligence. 
                        It features a responsive design with light and dark themes, smooth navigation transitions, and sections for my education, experience, certifications, and projects. 
                        Built from scratch, it reflects my passion for web development and design. The design draws inspiration from modern minimalism, with a focus on readability and user experience across devices.

                    <h3>How I Made It</h3>
                    <p class="project-description">
                        <li>Front-End uses <b>HTML5</b> and <b>CSS3</b>, leveraging custom variables for theming and a flexible grid system for responsiveness.</li>
                        <br>
                        <li><b>JavaScript</b> powers the interactivity, including a theme toggle that persists via localStorage, smooth scrolling navigation, and fade-in animations with the AOS library.</li>
                        <br>
                        <li>The navigation system uses event listeners to handle both internal section scrolling and external page transitions with a fade-out overlay effect.</li> 
                        <br> 
                        <li> libraries like Font Awesome for icons and AOS for animations were integrated via CDNs.</li> 
                    </p>
                    <h3>Challenges Faced</h3>
                    <p class="project-description">
                        <li>Coordinating the theme switch was tricky—ensuring all elements (text, backgrounds, buttons) updated seamlessly required careful CSS variable management and testing across light/dark modes.</li>
                        <br> 
                        <li> Navigation logic posed a challenge; I had to balance smooth scrolling for single-page sections with fade-out transitions for external pages, which involved tweaking timeouts and 
                        overlay styles.</li>
                        <br>
                        <li>Responsiveness was another hurdle—aligning the hero section’s text and image on mobile devices took multiple media query adjustments.</li>
                        <br>
                        <li>Debugging AOS animations to ensure they fired consistently across page loads also required trial and error.</li>
                    </p>
